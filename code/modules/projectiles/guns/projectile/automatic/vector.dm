	A Scarborough Arms logo is stamped on the side, though the SMG seems far better designed then most their usual product line. \
	Regardless it sports robust recoil control system that dampens it's shots to near nothing, a array of firing modes for the discerning shooter, \
	and even a folding stock for those with strong wrists or weak shoulders. Has threaded barrel for a silencer and a nice slot for a scope to be attached."
