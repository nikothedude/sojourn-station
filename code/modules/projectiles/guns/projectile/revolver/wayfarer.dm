	The Barrel is refined to use high-power 10x24 caseless munitions while being easy to clean. \
	While seemingly produced by Excelsior; hinted by the stamp placed upon its grip, it lacks most of the normal markings - and is instead tagged with a simple quote - \
	\"The hopeless don't revolt, because revolution is an act of hope.\""
